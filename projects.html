			<projectTitle> Predicting an airline’s stock price based on its on-time performance </projectTitle>
			<br>
			<date>December 2016</date>
			<br>
			<p>We worked on this project to understand if there was any hidden trend on how stock prices of an airline 
			company are affected by it’s on-time performance.</p>
			<p>Suppose, on a particular day, if majority of flights of a particular airline company are cancelled/delayed, it can be
			intuitively understood that this would affect the company’s stock prices.  A drop in the stock prices could be anticipated.</p>
			<p>However, this trend in stock prices may not be effectively predicted on regular days.  We were intrigued by this idea as there 
			might be a hidden trend in nature which may not be intuitive to understand, but Machine Learning ideas could be used in this scenario 
			to learn a close approximation of this hidden trend.</p>
			
			<p> Some noteworthy learnings and outcomes from this project were :</p>
			<ul style="margin-left:20px; font-size:100%;">
			<li> Considered real on-time performance data and stock trend data of American Airlines over a period of 13 months. </li>
			<li> Trained Random Forests, Support Vector Machines and several other classifiers to predict stock prices of future. </li>
			<li> We we able to predict if there would be an increase or decrease in Stock Prices with <b>75% accuracy</b>. </li>
			</ul>

			<projectTitle> Motion planning for a Sheep-Dog </projectTitle>
			<br>
			<date>October 2015 - December 2015</date>

			<p>We tried to explore the problem space of planning the motion of a dynamic body by in influencing 
			it with another dynamic body. To explore the problem space, we applied this to the sheep dog problem 
			where we program the robotic dog to herd the sheep towards the goal.</p>
			<p>The problem of moving an object (or a set of objects) to a desired goal state by in influencing 
			the object (or a set of objects) to be moved using another object that already has a notion of 
			where the goal is location has been addressed.</p>

			<projectTitle> Fabrication and Functioning of Fusion Deposition Modelling Machine </projectTitle>
			<br>
			<date>December 2012 - March 2013</date>
			<br>
			
			<p> The project was undertaken as my Engineering Final Project, teaming up with three other classmates. It was successfully 
			completed in 15 weeks on record low budget of under <b>₹20,000</b>. The 3D printer was based on Reprap mendel open source model.</p>

			<p>Arduino acted as the printer controller running teacup firmware, which was connected to a PC running the printer interface software.</p>

			<p> We were able to achieve near perfect prints out of ABS plastic with extrusion thinness being 0.3mm, with the dimensional 
			accuracy being 0.1mm. The maximum size of the print possible was 25x25x20 centimetres. The project was highly appreciated by 
			examiners/faculty during the final project review. </p>
			
			<p>Noteworthy challenges that we have faced during this project were :
			<ul style="margin-left:20px; font-size:100%;">
			<li> The mechanical structure had to be completely fabricated in college workshops by our team. </li>
			<li> Several parts had to be intricately machined to strict dimensional constaints.</li>
			<li> Extruder had to be machined out of brone, with a extrusion of just <b>0.25 mm</b>.</li>
			<li> Cylindrical sleeves were made out of PTFE with just <b>0.5mm</b> thickness. </li>
			<li> The electronics circuit boards required on the machine to drive the 5 stepper motors were prepared using Fritzing tool, 
			etched out and hand-soldered by our team. </li>
			</ul>

			<projectTitle> Study and Optimization project on Tree Climbing Robot </projectTitle>
			<br>
			<date>May 2012 - July 2012</date>
			<br>
			
			<p> The project was undertaken as summer internship at Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR), Bangalore. 
			CAIR is a premier robotic research laboratory under DRDO, currently working on several autonomous robots like UGV’s, UAV’s 
			amongst others required for use by the defence forces. Duration of the project – 6 weeks.</p>

			<p> Optimized the performance of the existing first iteration of a tree climbing robot which was being developed for surveillance purposes. </p>

			<p> I have worked on optimizing the electronic circuitry on the robot to improve the energy consumption. I have also reduced 
			the physical vulnerability of the Robot by reducing the number of wires running between the motorboard and motors.</p>

			<p> Several changes were done to the on-board electronics. The entire circuitry was redesigned, as the first iteration of the 
			robot was equipped with several prototyping boards instead of a single 	custom motherboard. </p>

			<p> A completely new mother board was designed from scratch and built specifically to ensure reduction in the number of loose 
			wires and efficiency in communicating with other components on the robot.</p>

			<projectTitle> Wireless Home Automation System with control via Smartphone </projectTitle>
			<br>
			<date>October 2012</date>
			<br>
			
			<img src="http://www.rajivmantena.net/images/wha.gif" width="300" id="inline" style="margin-left:20px;">
			<p> This project was based on Android and Arduino interaction via Bluetooth. It was executed in 2 weeks time along with two 
			other classmates. </p>
			
			<p> We were able to achieve complete practical operation of turning on or off any electronic appliance running at 230V/upto 5A.
			Key learnings from this project were :
			<ul style="margin-left:20px; font-size:100%;margin-bottom:10px;">
			<li> An <b>Andriod</b> app was configured to send out certain data bits via Bluetooth. </li>
			<li> <b>Arduino</b> was programmed to recieve and understand the data bits.</li>
			<li> Several Relays were connected to the Arduino, which would be turned on and off based on the data recieved.</li>
			<li> Each Relay acted as a switch for certain electrical device working at 230V. </li>
			</ul>
			
			<p> Based on the input received from the smartphone, Arduino would turn on/off the respective switch to power on/off the electrical devices. </p>

			<projectTitle> Autonomous Line Following Robot </projectTitle>
			<br>
			<date>September 2011</date>
			<br>
			
			<p> Working on Line follower was my first practical exposure towards robotics and the robot was heavily worked upon for a span 
			of over a year, resulting in several iterations resulting in optimising the efficiency, speed and intelligence of the robot. </p>
			
			<p> The first iteration consisted of an AVR Atmega microcontroller board with 5 IR LED pairs providing the necessary input. In 
			subsequent iterations, the control board was self designed and hand-soldered out of a single board including all the necessary electronics.</p>
