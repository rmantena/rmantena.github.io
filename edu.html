				I've attended <i><a href="http://www.bhavansnird.com/" target="_blank"><b>Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan's Vidyasharam</b></a></i> from 2000-07. 
				It was a small school nestled in the campus of NIRD, Hyderabad and is affiliated to CBSE. </p>
				
				<p>During my days at this school, I had the chance to represent it at various National level Olympiads and Quiz competitions. 
				My team secured the Second place in a State Level Quiz competition conducted by <i>Ministry of Non-Conventional Energy Sources</i> in 2006. 
				I wasn't the best sportsperson in my class, but was fortunate enough to represent my School in a inter-school Cricket match.</p>
				
				<p> <img src="images/scouts.png" width="60" height="73" id="inline" style="float:left;margin-right:20px;"> 
				I was involved with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bharat_Scouts_and_Guides" target="_blank">
				<i>Bharat Scouts and Guides</i></a>, the national Scouting and Guiding association of India, between the years 2004 and 2005. 
				It was a very rewarding volunteering experience that I would cherish for a long time. </p>
				
				<p>The most cherished memory that I have at <i>Bhavan's</i> is that I had been nominated as the 
				<b><i>Best all-round performer</i></b> of the graduating batch of 56 students.</p>
				
				<p>I graduated from this school with a 78.6% aggregate.</p>
				
				<p>I later completed my Intermediate Education at <i><b>Sri Chaitanya Jr. Kalasala</b></i> and graduated with a 89.6% aggregate in 2009. </p>

				I've joined <i><a href="http://www.mgit.ac.in/" target="_blank"><b>Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Technology</b></a></i> in 2009
				and graduated with a Bachelors of Technology degree in Mechatronics in 2013. MGIT is affiliated to <i><b>Jawaharlal Nehru 
				Technological University, Hyderabad</b></i>. The lush green campus of MGIT is spread over 30 acres of pleasant landscape at Gandipet.</p>
				
				<p>While at MGIT, I was actively involved in various technical and cultural events and was an enrolled student member of 
				<a href="https://www.iste.org/" target="_blank"><b>ISTE</b></a>.</p>
				
				<p>In the Summer of 2012, I had an internship opportunity at 
				<a href="http://www.drdo.gov.in/drdo/labs/CAIR/English/index.jsp?pg=homebody.jsp" target="_blank"><i><b>Center for Artificial 
				Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR)</a></b></i>, Bangalore. CAIR was a premier robotic research laboratory under <i><b>Defence Research 
				and Development Organisation (DRDO)</b></i> and the <i><b>Indian Ministry of Defence</b></i>. The project undertaken as 
				<b><a href="http://projects.rajivmantena.net/#cair"><i>Study and Optimization of a Tree Climbing Robot</i></a></b>.</p>
				
				<p>My thesis project that I have worked on was <a href="http://work.rajivmantena.net/#fdm"><i><b>Fabrication of Fusion Deposition Modelling Machine</i></a></b>. I along with three other 
				students have successfully built the Prototyping machine to working order in 15 weeks and in a record low budget of <i><b>₹20,000</i></b>. </p>
				
				<p>I graduated from this college with an aggregate of 66.3%.</p>
